    "Answer- Since the average selling price of an article is  Rs 250 with a standard deviation of Rs 47.00 suggest that there is some variability in the prices of food items at the restaurant. The median value being close to the mean of Rs 202.00 indicates that the distribution of prices is relatively symmetrical.\n",
    "The median value being close to the mean of Rs 202.00 indicates that the distribution of prices is relatively symmetrical so one can become a regular customer to the restaurant. But in my opinion Whether or not you would become a regular customer of the restaurant depends on several factors beyond just the statistics of the price distribution.Some factors you might consider are your personal budget, the quality of the food and service, the restaurant's ambiance, location, and the overall value you perceive for the price you would pay."

    "Answer- Measuring the height of all men on Earth is an enormous task and practically impossible to accomplish. However, if such an endeavor were attempted, it would require a well-planned and representative sampling strategy. Here is a suggested approach:\n",

    "Define the target population: Determine the specific criteria for identifying the population of men whose heights will be measured. This could include factors such as age range, geographical locations, ethnic diversity, and other relevant characteristics.\n",
