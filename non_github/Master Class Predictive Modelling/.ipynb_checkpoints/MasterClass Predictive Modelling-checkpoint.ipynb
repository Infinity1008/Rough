It helps identify fraudulent activities by analyzing patterns and risk factors associated with fraudulent behavior. Logistic regression models can flag suspicious transactions, assess the probability of fraud, and trigger further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Human Resources**: Logistic regression is employed in human resources for various applications, including employee attrition prediction, performance evaluation, and hiring decisions. By analyzing employee characteristics, performance metrics, and other factors, logistic regression models can assist in identifying the likelihood of an employee leaving the organization, predicting job performance, and making informed hiring decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Environmental Science**: Logistic regression is used in environmental studies to predict the occurrence of certain events, such as the presence or absence of a particular species based on environmental variables. It helps in ecological modeling, species distribution analysis, and conservation planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint - Similar to linear regression, Logistic Regression has it's variants based on different penalty ```l1```, ```l2```, ```elasticnet``` are some of them."
